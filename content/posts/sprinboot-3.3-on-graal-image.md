## What is a Native Image?

GraalVM native image is an ahead-of-time compilation technology that generates native executables.
Native executables have low resource usages and fast startup time in a compact packaging.

It is an ideal candidate for serverless workloads in Java.

I use it to create hobby projects, so I don't exhaust my free tier quotas on services like [fly.io](fly.io) ðŸ˜‰

GraalVM Native Image is a broad topic with many resources and videos available for a deeper understanding.
The [Official documentation](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/) is a great place to start.

## What's the catch?

Java is a dynamic programing language and libraries use reflections. Not all libraries work with GraalVM, and you may encounter issues. 
[Libraries and Framework support](https://www.graalvm.org/native-image/libraries-and-frameworks/)

All the class and bytecodes that are reachable at runtime should be known at build time.

## What are we building?

This blog series is the start of building a native springboot applications with GraalVM native Image.
We will start with a simple baseline application with Postgres DB.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Java 21

## Let's do some coding!


Springboot 3.3 has made it very easy to spin-up a native application and with paketo buildpacks
there barely any difference between packaging a jar and a native executable.

### Creating springboot project

we'll start off by going to [https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/) to create our first springboot
application

### First run setup

Now, let's add a JPA datasource to our application and include Actuator for health checks.

``` yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: ${SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL:jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres}
    username: ${SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME:postgres}
    password: ${SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME:postgres}
    driver-class-name: org.postgresql.Driver

  jpa:
    hibernate:
    show-sql: true
    properties:
      hibernate:
        dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect

management:
  endpoint:
    health:
      show-details: always
  health:
    diskspace:
      enabled: false
```

#### Setting up our docker 

Open a terminal window and navigate to your project root directory.

We need a postgres instance for our app to connect to and for the let's use the docker run command.

Let's create a docker network first. We need containers to be on the same docker network to connect each other

```bash
docker network create spring-native-app-network
```

Now, we'll bring up a postgres container

```bash
docker run --rm --name postgres-db --network spring-native-app-network -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:latest
```

#### Building our native image

Here's the magic! [Packaging OCI Images](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/maven-plugin/build-image.html)

```bash
./mvn -Pnative spring-boot:build-image
```

Building the native image is resource-intensive, but once completed, you can spin up the container with the following command.

```bash
docker run -d --rm --name inventory-service --network spring-native-app-network -e SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://postgres-db:5432/postgres -e SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=postgres -e SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=postgres -p 8080:8080 inventory-service:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

Goto [http://localhost:8080/actuator/health](http://localhost:8080/actuator/health) and we should see

## Comparison with JVM Image on idle

| Metrics      | JVM      | Native   |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| Image size   | 382.13MB | 188.68MB |
| Startup time | 2.337s   | 0.223s   |
| Memory Usage | 338.3MB  | 100.2MB  |
